# memeGenerator

In this project, I develop a Meme Generator using JS, CSS3 & HTML5.

## MVP

The MVP contains the following:

- header with name of app
- input pane
  - 1 pre-set image, thumbnail
  - 1 label text & input field for text
- output pane (preview)
  - image
  - input text at fixed position on image: bottom (with margin), centered
  - in bottom left corner (outside image): button "Save as image"
- footer with copyright and imprint

## Milestones

- [x] Create basic HTML structure and basic SASS.
- [x] Create input form.
- [x] Show output text in output pane (with JS, no image yet).
- [x] Add thumbnail and image.
- [x] Finetune output text on image (length, deletions).
- [ ] Add submit button.
- [ ] Review layout, fonts, color scheme, etc.

## Future Features

- If input text is too long:
  - Improve CSS of error message (input field frame red, warning symbol, etc.)
  - Improve functionality: offer second line, or similar.
- Let user change horizontal alignment: offer options for left, centered, right.
- Let user change font size.
- Let user chang font: offer selection of black fonts.
