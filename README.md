# memeGenerator

In this project, I develop a Meme Generator using JS, CSS3 & HTML5. 

The MVP contains the following:

* input pane
  * 1 pre-set image, thumbnail
  * 1 label text & input field for text
* output pane (preview
  * image
  * input text at fixed position on image: bottom (with margin), centered
  * in bottom left corner (outside image): button "Save as image"
